Sitemaps are a way to tell search engines about pages on your site we might not otherwise discover. In its simplest terms, a XML Sitemap is a list of the pages on your website. Creating and submitting a Sitemap helps make sure that all search engines knows about all the pages on your site, including URLs that may not be discoverable by Google's normal crawling process.
